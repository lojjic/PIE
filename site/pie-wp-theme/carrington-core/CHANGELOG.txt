# Carrington Core Framework Changelog

## 3.0

- Added support for custom post types (WordPress 3.0)
- Support for child themes (including adding templates in child themes that do not exist in the parent theme)
- Allow custom functions to be filtered into the Single and Comment template selection process (already supported in General context selection)
- make the posts_per_page setting work as intended (only on initial query)
- Support for nesting directories in misc/ and forms/
- Removed use of deprecated function `get_the_author_ID`. Replaced with 2.8 `get_the_author_meta` (since 2.8.0). Users of versions of WordPress prior to 2.8.0 should be aware this change will cause problems for them.
- Define required Carrington settings in a more forgiving way, making it easier to use just part of Carrington on a site when desired
- make gallery settings (implemented in CSS) specific to each gallery
- home.php is now only used in is_home() situations, not is_front_page() (reverses feature requested and added in v. 2.5)
- Added changelog

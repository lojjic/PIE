<h1>Building PIE From Source</h1>



<!-- noformat on -->

<p>This document describes how you can build PIE from the most recent source code. This is useful if you want to get a feature or bug fix which hasn't yet made it into a release package. It's also necessary if you want to make changes to the code yourself to try and fix a bug or implement a new feature. If you do so, please consider contributing your changes back to the main project so we can all benefit!</p>

<h2 id="prereqs">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Building PIE is straightforward. You need  to have the following tools installed:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, if you are going to be checking out the source from the Git repository</li>
    <li><a href="http://java.com">Java</a> runtime, version 6 or higher</li>
    <li><a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>, for performing the build</li>
</ol>

<p>Once these prerequisites are installed, perform the following steps:</p>



<h2 id="getsource">Get the source code</h2>

<p>You have two options for getting the source:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check out the source using Git:
        <pre><kbd>git clone git://github.com/lojjic/PIE.git
cd PIE</kbd></pre>
        If you want the 2.x unstable branch then you're done; if you want the 1.x stable branch then run:
        <pre><kbd>git checkout 1.x</kbd></pre>
        or:
    </li>
    <li>Download an archive of the source:<br>
        <a href="http://github.com/lojjic/PIE/archives/master">http://github.com/lojjic/PIE/archives/master</a> (2.x unstable branch)<br>
        <a href="http://github.com/lojjic/PIE/archives/1.x">http://github.com/lojjic/PIE/archives/1.x</a> (1.x stable branch)
    </li>
</ol>



<h2 id="build">Perform the build</h2>

<p>From the root directory of your local copy of the source code, invoke the following command in the terminal:</p>

<pre><kbd>ant</kbd></pre>

<p>This will perform the build, creating a new directory named "build/". This directory will contain the following
artifacts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>PIE.htc - The fully compressed behavior file; this is the version which should be deployed in production
    environments.</li>
    <li>PIE_uncompressed.htc - An uncompressed version of the behavior; this is useful for debugging purposes but is
    very large so it should not be deployed in production environments.</li>
    <li>PIE.js - The compressed version of the alternate <a href="/documentation/pie-js/">JavaScript edition</a> of
    PIE. PIE.htc is the recommended file for most users.</li>
    <li>PIE_uncompressed.js - The uncompressed version of the JavaScript edition.</li>
</ul>
